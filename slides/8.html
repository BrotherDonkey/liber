        <h1>You get a design ...</h1>
        <p>... (hypothetically) it contains things that do not exist in the design system.</p>
        <p>This is how to get something into Atlas.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Visit the design system to look or ask team member who might know.</li>
            <li>Begin a discussion @ <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/atlas-design/discussions">https://github.com/microsoft/atlas-design/discussions</a></li>
            <li>Get quorum from the design folks. Get design signoff.</li>
            <li>Lead designers will approve the new feature for Atlas. (Or they won't, and they'll communicate with the designer.)</li>
            <li>Make a work item to add it to Atlas. Write well and thoroughly. Parent it under the feature you're working on.</li>
            <li>Write the code, or wait until someone else has time to write the code. Write a changeset. Do a PR. Get review.</li>
            <li>Changesets</li>
            <li>Well ... you still need to get that change into docs-ui.</li>
        </ol>
