			<h1>Where we are versus where we want to be</h1>
			<p>✅ Initialize an open source css framework</p>
			<p>✅ Init a new design system website</p>
			<p>🔃 Integrate with docs-ui</p>
			<p>⏭ Polish design system website</p>
			<p>⏭ Migrate/create components</p>
			<p>... continued improvement.</p>

		<h2>We working on ...</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Moving tried and true components into Atlas (with design and dev review)</li>
			<li>Improving developer and designer facing documentation</li>
			<li>Providing more full featured atomic classes.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>So where does that put me?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>🔔 Atlas does not current have everything you need yet.</li>
			<li>
				Most of the bigwig components will be around a while in docs-ui. (Think button, card, columns, etc).
			</li>
			<li>Whenever possible use the an Atlas classes over one that exists in docs-ui.</li>
			<li>We're brainstorming ideas that should allow you to more easily check if a class is in Atlas.</li>
			<li>
				Be ware the "remove after template rebuild comment" in docs-ui's scss. We are working to remove
				duplicate functionality. This means a class is marked for deletion.
			</li>
			<li>Avoid creating new classes in docs-ui, 🙏. But we will forgive you if you <em>have<em> to.</li>
			<li>
				If there is some functionality that you think we need and that we don't have. Send a PR, or tell us about it!
