            <h2>We are working on ...</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Moving good components into Atlas (with design and dev review)</li>
                <li>Improving developer and designer facing documentation</li>
                <li>Providing more full featured atomic classes.</li>
                <li>Removing duplicate functionality from docs-ui.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>How does an existing component get moved?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A discussion begins. (Github Discussions)</li>
                <li>Design review of (proposed/existing) component. (Figma / Code) </li>
                <li>Pull request into Atlas.</li>
                <li>Documentation pull request into Atlas site.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>So where does that put me?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>üîî Atlas does not currently have everything you need yet.</li>
                <li>
                    Most of the bigwig components are prioritized for migration from docs-ui into Atlas. (Think button, card, columns, etc).
                </li>
                <li>It's okay to use existing docs-ui components.</li>
                <li>Whenever possible use an Atlas feature over one that exists in docs-ui.</li>
                <li>We're brainstorming ideas that could allow you to more easily check if a class is in Atlas.</li>
                <li>
                    Be ware the "remove after template rebuild comment" in docs-ui's scss. This comment a class is marked for deletion. We are working to take away
                    duplicate functionality. 
                </li>
                <li>Avoid creating new classes in docs-ui, üôè. But we will certainly forgive you if you <em>have<em> to.</li>
                <li>
                    If there is some functionality that you think we need and that we don't have. Tell us about it or send a PR!
